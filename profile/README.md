## 🧠 Overview  

**Houdini** is a high-end 3D software package built around a powerful procedural workflow, allowing artists and technical creators to construct complex scenes through flexible node-based systems. It is widely used in visual effects, animation, simulations, and game development pipelines where precision and scalability are essential.

Unlike traditional layer-based tools, Houdini emphasizes non-destructive creation. Every action remains adjustable, making it easy to refine details, reuse setups, and iterate without rebuilding entire scenes. This approach provides exceptional control over geometry, materials, dynamics, and environments.

The software is especially valued for its simulation capabilities, enabling realistic effects such as smoke, fire, fluids, debris, and crowds. Combined with strong rendering and scripting support, Houdini adapts seamlessly to both artistic exploration and technical production requirements.
